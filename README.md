# Store

## Project to increase my skills in Java/Js tools

- Basically this one is about a store but my plans involve using microservices' architeture to send requests to the other project which computes freight transport services and costs. The complete architeture will be shown according to what I develop, but wait for Rabbit, SSE, Microservices and also for Spring Security Authentication.

> Into the Master Branch you can see a tecnhical **README** and project files.
